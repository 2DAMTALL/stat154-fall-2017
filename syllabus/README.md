## Matrix Algebra Housekeeping

- __Dates__: Aug 28-Sep 01
- __Topics__: Quick review of objects and functions in R to handle common (and not so common) matrix operations in R. Review of how to express basic statistical operations with vector-matrix notation, and discuss their geometric interpretations. Description of the data matrix, its rows-and-columns duality, and the various types of cross-products.
- __Slides__:
    + Matrix operations in R
    + Statistical operations with vector-matrix notation
    + The duality of the data matrix, and common cross-products X'X and XX'
- __Lab 1__: Matrix stuff (on your own)

-----

## Matrix Decompositions in R

- __Dates__: Sep 04-08
- __Topics__: Review of matrix Decompositions with R, talking about the functions `svd()` and `eigen()`, the implications of the decompositions, data reduction, and visual displays.
- __Slides__:
    + Singular Valude Decomposition (SVD)
    + Eigenvalue Decomposition (EVD)
- __Lab 2__: Matrix decompositions and the power algorithm

-----

## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)

- __Dates__: Sep 11-15
- __Topics__: Principal Components Analysis. Unsepervised learning approach for studying the structure of a data set (with quantiative variables). How PCA is connected with the SVD and EVD decompositions, interpretation of the outputs, and usefulness for Exploratory Data Analysis.

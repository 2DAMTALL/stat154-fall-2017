## Rubric for Evaluating Assignments


Each assignment will be graded out of four points: 

- __completeness__: one point for making a good-faith effort at every part of the assignment.
- __correctness__: one point for technically-correct, working solutions to each part.
- __coding__: one point for clean, well-formatted, easily readable code.
- __description__: one point for clear descriptions, interpretations, explanations.

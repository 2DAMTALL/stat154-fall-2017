# Roc Curve

This app is based on chapter 11 from Applied Preictive Modeling.


## Running the app

The easiest way to run an app is with the `runGitHub()` function from the `"shiny"` package:

```R
# install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)

# Run an app from a subdirectory in the repo
runGitHub("stat154-fall-2017", "ucb-stat154", subdir = "apps/roc-curve")
```
